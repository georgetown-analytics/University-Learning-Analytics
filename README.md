# University-Learning-Analytics
Cohort 16 Capstone Project for the Certificate of Data Science at Georgetown University School of Continuing Studies.


Team: Oat Milk Learning (University Learning Analytics)

University degree and certificate programs that are completely online have expanded the accessibility to education.  However, the mode of delivery creates new challenges for teachers to assess student performance. Our project aimed to examine the characteristics of online behavior of university students with the goal of identifying those at risk of failing a class through a classification model.  This can be used to alert teachers when additional intervention is required during the term to pass the class and achieve their educational objectives.

The original dataset contains 22 module-presentations, 32,593 registered students, and their respective assessment results, interaction with the VLE represented by the daily summaries of student clicks (10,655,280 entries in total). The dataset used was part of a kaggle competition and was made freely available at: https://analyse.kmi.open.ac.uk/open_dataset under a CC-BY 4.0 license. Kuzilek J., Hlosta M., Zdrahal Z.
